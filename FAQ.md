## Terminology

**What is an “instance”?**

An instance is a single place where your account can be hosted, but you can easily communicate with and follow people on other instance as though you were on the same site. 

**What is Tusky?**

Tusky is a client for Mastodon, a free and open-	source social network server. Share words, photos, and videos with folks!

**What is a Mastodon?**

A prehistoric animal, predecessor of the mammoth. Essentially a fluffy elephant. 

**Why the name Mastodon?**

It's pretty metal. (There's a progressive metal band with the same name)

## Organization

**How is Mastodon funded?**

Development of Mastodon and hosting of mastodon.social is funded through [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/mastodon) and [Liberapay]( https://liberapay.com/Mastodon/). Beyond that, the project is not interested in VC funding, monetizing, advertising, or anything of that sort. Beyond Patreon and Liberapay, donations can be sent via:

[PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/gargron)

BTC: 17j2g7vpgHhLuXhN4bueZFCvdxxieyRVWd

ETH: 0xC2d182De4604655CD420aE5739aE603DD7305C85
	
The software is free and open source and communities should host their own servers if they can, that way the costs are more or less distributed. Many instances have their own Patreon and Liberapay pages, among other community funding methods.

## Personal Use

**This looks a lot like Twitter, what’s the difference?**

Mastodon is decentralized. Anyone can run a Mastodon server, under their own community rules. Twitter is run by a central authority, and sets the rules for everyone.

**How do I get this on Android?**

If you use Chrome or Firefox for Android, you can add Mastodon to your homescreen. It will act as a native app in many ways including push notifications. 

**How do I search?**

You can search for people and hashtags, but not general text. Use the box above the tooting area. If you are on the mobile layout, click the pen in the navigation.

**Does it support Push notifications?**

Yes it does 

**Does it support multiple accounts? How can I do this?**

Yes and yes! If you find another instance you would like to join, sign up! Note that not all instances are open to new registrations and it’s possible that someone has already taken your preferred username.

**How do I enable Two-factor Authentication?**

The option will be in Preferences under Two-factor Authentication. [Mastodon's 2FA](https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Using-Mastodon/2FA.md) uses both a QR code and plain-text secrets.

**What’s “CW”?**

“CW” stands for “Content Warning.” You can use it to hide your toot's text and image behind a warning, like a spoiler.

**Is Mastodon moderated?**

Each instance handles moderation differently, and each has their own moderators. It’s okay to ask what the rules are for the instance you are on. Usually the rules are posted on the instance's about page ([like the “more” page at Mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/about/more))

**How do I report offensive content?**

Beneath each post, you will see three dots. Clicking on those will allow you to expand a post or report the content. When reporting content, select all posts that need moderator attention.

**How do I handle harassment?**

If your admin takes harassment seriously, you can report it to them through the post-reporting system. This can be found through the ellipsis (“…”) beneath the post, or by contacting your admin directly.

**Will my Private Messages reach people on other instances?**

Private (followers-only) and direct messages will definitely reach people on Mastodon instances of version 1.6 and higher. They will not be sent to servers that only implement OStatus. You are unlikely to encounter such servers however.

**Can a toot be edited?**

No, sorry. But you could delete your toot and rewrite…

**If I delete a post, does it get deleted everywhere?**

Deleting a post propagates to the same places where the original post went. As a rule, it means yes, it gets deleted everywhere. There can be network delays and processing delays. Under rare circumstances a copy could remain somewhere, especially if the post was public.

**How do I view my favorite toots?**

From the Getting Started menu, click Favourites. If you Getting Started menu isn't open, that's the Asterisk (*) icon in the navigation.

**Can I quote a toot?**

No. It's possible to link to toots like to any webpage, but we believe that the quote feature encourages toxic behaviour so it's deliberately omitted.

**If my instance shuts down forever, do I lose my data?**

Yes, you do.
