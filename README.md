# Tusky

![](/assets/tusky_logo.png)

Tusky is a beautiful Android client for [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon). Mastodon is a GNU social-compatible federated social network. That means not one entity controls the whole network, rather, like e-mail, volunteers and organisations operate their own independent servers, users from which can all interact with each other seamlessly.

#### Head of development

The current maintainer is [ConnyDuck@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/users/ConnyDuck).

## Building
The most basic things needed are the Java Development Kit 7 or higher and the Android SDK.

The project uses [the Gradle build system](https://gradle.org). Android studio uses Gradle by default, so it'd be straightforward to import this repository using your chosen version control software from the menu:
<pre>VCS > Checkout from version control > Git/SVN/Mercurial</pre>
After making it into an android studio project you can build/run as you wish.

It's also possible to build using Gradle by itself on the command line if you have it installed and configured. This repository includes a gradle wrapper script that can be used, following this guide [Build You App On The Command Line](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/building-cmdline.html).

The project's gradle files describe its building needs more in-depth and dependencies can be found in ```app/build.gradle```.
