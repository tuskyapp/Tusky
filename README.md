# Tusky

![](/fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/icon.png)

Tusky is a beautiful Android client for some [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon) instances. Mastodon is a GNU social-compatible federated social network. That means not one entity controls the whole network, rather, like e-mail, volunteers and organisations operate their own independent servers, users from which can all interact with each other seamlessly. While Tusky is not fully compliant, it supports most Mastodon features on most Mastodon instances.
