<h1>Payment Policy</h1>  

We provide payment for work done on the Tusky project, including but not limited to, Coding, Code Review, Design, and User Support. We also reimburse all costs necessary to keep the project running, e.g. servers, hosting, domain renewals, and the occasional merchandise drop to promote the project.

We primarily use our budget to enable contributors who would otherwise not be able to contribute, and prioritize payments to such need-based contributors. 

<ul>
  <li>Payments for one-off contributions are welcome, but the scope of the work must be discussed and approved in our Matrix-based <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#Tusky-Code:matrix.org" target="_new">Tusky Code room</a> prior to the work commencing.</li> 
        <ul>
          <li>Payment amounts for one-off contributions will be determined based on the scope of the work and amount of funds available, both of which will be discussed and agreed upon by the contributor and team up front. The payment amount will be considered approved with the sign-off of one of our <a href="https://opencollective.com/tusky#category-ABOUT" target="_new">OpenCollective Admins</a> after the discussion has occurred.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Regular contributors can submit for payments based on a team-approved individual agreement.</li>
    <li>Payment requests are approved by our <a href="https://opencollective.com/tusky#category-ABOUT" target="_new">OpenCollective Admins</a>. Admins <i>cannot</i> approve their own payment requests.</li>
    <li>Payments have a soft cap of $500/month per contributor. Additional amounts may not be considered without a broad team consensus.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Expense Submissions</h2>

Payment requests should be submitted monthly for the previous month's work. A description of the work must be included. Some examples:
