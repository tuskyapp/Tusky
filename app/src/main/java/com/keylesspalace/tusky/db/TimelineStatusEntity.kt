/**
 * We're trying to play smart here. Server sends us reblogs as two entities one embedded into
 * another (reblogged status is a field inside of "reblog" status). But it's really inefficient from
 * the DB perspective and doesn't matter much for the display/interaction purposes.
 * What if when we store reblog we don't store almost empty "reblog status" but we store
 * *reblogged* status and we embed "reblog status" into reblogged status. This reversed
 * relationship takes much less space and is much faster to fetch (no N+1 type queries or JSON
 * serialization).
 * "Reblog status", if present, is marked by [reblogServerId], and [reblogAccountId]
 * fields.
