/**
 * Created by charlag on 12/07/2017.
 *
 * Class to represent data required to display either a notification or a placeholder.
 * It is either a {@link Placeholder} or a {@link Concrete}.
 * It is modelled this way because close relationship between placeholder and concrete notification
 * is fine in this case. Placeholder case is not modelled as a type of notification because
 * invariants would be violated and because it would model domain incorrectly. It is prefereable to
 * {@link com.keylesspalace.tusky.util.Either} because class hierarchy is cheaper, faster and
 * more native.
