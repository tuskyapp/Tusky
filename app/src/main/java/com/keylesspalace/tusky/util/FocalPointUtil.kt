     * How it works is using the following steps:
     *   - First we determine if the image is too wide or too tall for the view size. If it is
     *   too wide, we need to crop it horizontally and scale the height to fit the view
     *   exactly. If it is too tall we need to crop vertically and scale the width to fit the
     *   view exactly.
     *   - Then we determine what translation is needed to get the focal point in view. We
     *   prefer to get the focal point at the center of the preview. However if that would
     *   result in some part of the preview being empty, we instead align the image so that it
     *   fills the view, but still the focal point is always in view.
     *
     * @param viewWidth The width of the imageView.
     * @param viewHeight The height of the imageView
     * @param imageWidth The width of the actual image
     * @param imageHeight The height of the actual image
     * @param focus The focal point to focus
     * @param mat The matrix to update, this matrix is reset() and then updated with the new
     * configuration. We reuse the old matrix to prevent unnecessary allocations.
     *
     * @return The matrix which correctly crops the image
