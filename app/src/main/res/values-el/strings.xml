         * you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”.
           We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom,
           to show we do not mean the software is gratis. Source: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html
